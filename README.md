===========

#IMPORTANT:
Using Python 3.3 with Pygame

Windows 8.1

IDE: Pycharm (which is why there are a bunch of files that seem like giberish and not related to Python)

#ALREADY IMPLIMENTED
+ Basic Drawings
+ Main Loop
+ Basic Controls
+ Sprint
+ Basic collision detection for world objects (slight bug where bottom and right clipping of player is off)
+ World Grid (right now only 64x48 (40px by 40px blocks))
+ Damage and Healing system
+ 60 fps ticks (Pygame feature, hopefully I'm using it correctly and no issues pop up for lower FPS such as the game running in slow motion)

#GOING TO IMPLIMENT
- World map (next priority)

- Dungeon maps

- map editor

- enemies

- weapons

- npcs

- save states (for player and world)

- build it into an executable file

#CONTROLS (will change)
+ "wasd" movement
+ "q/e" hurt/heal
+ "f" debug mode for collision

#NOTES
I've tried to set things up so that the basic features can easily be built into bigger features
